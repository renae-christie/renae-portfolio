## 📝 Customizing Content

### Updating Text Content

All text content is in the HTML files. Look for these sections:

- **About Me**: Edit the paragraphs in `index.html` under `<section id="about">`
- **Skills**: Edit skill lists in `index.html` under `<section id="skills">`
- **Projects**: Edit project descriptions in each project HTML file
- **Contact Info**: Already set to your email, phone, and LinkedIn

### Adding More Projects

1. Duplicate one of the project HTML files
2. Rename it (e.g., `new-project.html`)
3. Update the content inside
4. Add a new project card to `index.html` in the projects section
5. Create a new image folder: `images/projects/new-project/`

### Changing Colors

The main color scheme uses sage green (`#4a7c59`). To change colors:

1. Open any HTML file
2. Find the `<style>` section at the top
3. Search for `#4a7c59` (sage green)
4. Replace with your preferred color code

3. Save the file
